# Overview

The Nx Plugin OpenAPI brings first class support for using the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) within your Nx workspace leveraging all powerful features of the Nx task pipeline.

## What is OpenAPI Generator?

[OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) is a powerful tool that can generate API client libraries, server stubs, documentation, and configuration files from OpenAPI specifications. This plugin specifically focuses on generating TypeScript Angular clients.

- Caches based on file content, not timestamps
- Dramatically speeds up builds in large monorepos

### ðŸ”§ **Flexible Configuration**
